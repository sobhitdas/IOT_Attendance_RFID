# IOT_Attendance_RFID
This is an IOT attendance project using the rfid module reciever.Whenever an user brings his UID card near the Rfid reciever,the modules reads data present inside it and sends it to a google sheet api wherein the excel sheet is updated with the user's record

# About RFID:
Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) refers to a wireless system comprised of two components: tags and readers. The reader is a device that has one or more antennas that emit radio waves and receive signals back from the RFID tag. Tags, which use radio waves to communicate their identity and other information to nearby readers, can be passive or active. Passive RFID tags are powered by the reader and do not have a battery. Active RFID tags are powered by batteries.

RFID tags can store a range of information from one serial number to several pages of data. Readers can be mobile so that they can be carried by hand, or they can be mounted on a post or overhead. Reader systems can also be built into the architecture of a cabinet, room, or building

RFID systems use radio waves at several different frequencies to transfer data. In health care and hospital settings, RFID technologies include the following applications:

Inventory control
Equipment tracking
Out-of-bed detection and fall detection
Personnel tracking
Ensuring that patients receive the correct medications and medical devices
Preventing the distribution of counterfeit drugs and medical devices
Monitoring patients
Providing data for electronic medical records systems
